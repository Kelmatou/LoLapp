# LoLapp
League of Legends game tracker application

# Features
- Automatically start looking at your game when it begins
- League Chat
- Champion information
- Path information
- History information

# Note
With 2017 Riot API Update, getting stats for champions became
deprecated and not replaced.
So it became impossible too much expensive to calculate KDA
or winrate.
This is why I decided to stop updating this application.

You can still download this code and add any features.
